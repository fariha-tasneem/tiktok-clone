# TikTok Clone
During my semester long internship with the UVA Development Hub, one of the projects I worked on was creating a clone of the social media app, TikTok, by leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I utilized MongoDB to test the application and upload TikTok videos that will be visible to the user. I had a lot of fun building this application and further exploring the design side of development!
