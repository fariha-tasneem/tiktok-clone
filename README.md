# TikTok Clone
During my semester long internship with the UVA Development Hub, one of the projects I worked on was creating a clone of the social media app, TikTok. I utilized MongoDB to test the application and upload actual TikTok videos that are visible to the user. I had a lot of fun building this application and exploring more of the design side of development!
